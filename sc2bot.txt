Write a StarCraft2 bot with if iteration action in Python

--------------------------
Creating a full StarCraft 2 bot is a complex task and requires significant knowledge of the game and its mechanics. However, I can provide you with a basic example of a bot using the python-sc2 library, which is a Python wrapper for the StarCraft II API. This example will only showcase simple actions with if-iteration.

First, you'll need to install the python-sc2 library:

Copy code
pip install sc2


Here's a simple example of a bot that trains SCVs and builds Supply Depots:

python
Copy code
import random
from sc2 import run_game, maps, Race, Difficulty
from sc2.player import Bot, Computer
from sc2.constants import COMMANDCENTER, SCV, SUPPLYDEPOT

class SimpleBot(sc2.BotAI):
    async def on_step(self, iteration):
        await self.distribute_workers()  # Automatically distribute worker mining
        await self.train_scv()
        await self.build_supply_depot()

    async def train_scv(self):
        for cc in self.units(COMMANDCENTER).ready.noqueue:
            if self.can_afford(SCV) and self.supply_left > 0:
                await self.do(cc.train(SCV))

    async def build_supply_depot(self):
        if self.supply_left < 5 and not self.already_pending(SUPPLYDEPOT):
            cc = self.units(COMMANDCENTER).ready
            if cc.exists:
                if self.can_afford(SUPPLYDEPOT):
                    await self.build(SUPPLYDEPOT, near=cc.first.position.towards(self.game_info.map_center, 5))

def main():
    run_game(maps.get("AbyssalReefLE"), [
        Bot(Race.Terran, SimpleBot()),
        Computer(Race.Zerg, Difficulty.Easy)
    ], realtime=True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()


This bot will distribute workers for mining, train SCVs at the Command Center if there's enough supply, and build Supply Depots if the supply is running low. To make a competitive StarCraft 2 bot, you would need to implement more advanced game strategies, unit management, and decision-making.
--------------------------
Add Scout and attack function
--------------------------
To add scouting and attacking functions to the SimpleBot example, you can modify the class as follows:

python
Copy code
from sc2.constants import BARRACKS, MARINE

class SimpleBot(sc2.BotAI):
    async def on_step(self, iteration):
        await self.distribute_workers()  # Automatically distribute worker mining
        await self.train_scv()
        await self.build_supply_depot()
        await self.build_barracks()
        await self.train_marine()
        await self.scout()
        await self.attack()

    async def build_barracks(self):
        if not self.units(BARRACKS).ready.exists and not self.already_pending(BARRACKS):
            if self.can_afford(BARRACKS):
                await self.build(BARRACKS, near=self.units(COMMANDCENTER).first)

    async def train_marine(self):
        for barracks in self.units(BARRACKS).ready.noqueue:
            if self.can_afford(MARINE) and self.supply_left > 0:
                await self.do(barracks.train(MARINE))

    async def scout(self):
        scout = self.units(SCV).idle.random_or(None)
        if scout and not self.known_enemy_units:
            target = self.enemy_start_locations[0]
            await self.do(scout.move(target))

    async def attack(self):
        if self.units(MARINE).amount > 10:
            for marine in self.units(MARINE).idle:
                target = self.enemy_start_locations[0]
                await self.do(marine.attack(target))


This adds the following functionality:

Building Barracks: A simple check to build a Barracks if none exist.
Training Marines: Train Marines in the existing Barracks if there's enough supply.
Scouting: Send an idle SCV to the enemy's starting location if the bot hasn't discovered any enemy units.
Attacking: When there are more than 10 Marines, send them to attack the enemy's starting location.

This is still a basic example and lacks advanced strategies, but it demonstrates how to add scouting and attacking functionality to your bot.
--------------------------
Add select target efficiently function
--------------------------
To efficiently select attack targets for your units, you can create a function that chooses the target based on certain priorities, such as enemy unit types, distances, or other factors. In this example, we'll create a function that selects the closest target to a given unit.

Modify the SimpleBot class by adding the select_target function:

python
Copy code
class SimpleBot(sc2.BotAI):
    async def on_step(self, iteration):
        # ... (previous code)

    async def select_target(self, unit):
        targets = self.known_enemy_units
        if targets.exists:
            return targets.closest_to(unit)
        else:
            return self.enemy_start_locations[0]

    async def scout(self):
        scout = self.units(SCV).idle.random_or(None)
        if scout and not self.known_enemy_units:
            target = self.select_target(scout)
            await self.do(scout.move(target))

    async def attack(self):
        if self.units(MARINE).amount > 10:
            for marine in self.units(MARINE).idle:
                target = self.select_target(marine)
                await self.do(marine.attack(target))


The select_target function finds the closest target among the known enemy units. If no enemy units are known, it defaults to the enemy's starting location. This function is used in both the scout and attack methods to determine where the units should move or attack.

You can further improve the target selection by considering factors like enemy unit types, their health, and their threat level. This would require more complex decision-making logic and potentially some machine learning techniques to optimize the bot's performance.
--------------------------
Add exploring function please
--------------------------
To add an exploring function to the SimpleBot, you can create a function that sends idle units to explore unexplored areas of the map. In this example, we'll create a function called explore that sends idle SCVs to explore random locations.

Modify the SimpleBot class by adding the explore function:

python
Copy code
import random

class SimpleBot(sc2.BotAI):
    async def on_step(self, iteration):
        await self.distribute_workers()  # Automatically distribute worker mining
        await self.train_scv()
        await self.build_supply_depot()
        await self.build_barracks()
        await self.train_marine()
        await self.scout()
        await self.attack()
        await self.explore()

    # ... (previous code)

    async def explore(self):
        if self.units(SCV).idle.exists and not self.known_enemy_units:
            for scv in self.units(SCV).idle:
                target = self.random_location_variance(scv.position, max_distance=25)
                await self.do(scv.move(target))

    def random_location_variance(self, position, max_distance=10):
        x_offset = random.randint(-max_distance, max_distance)
        y_offset = random.randint(-max_distance, max_distance)
        new_position = position.offset((x_offset, y_offset))
        return new_position.clamp(0, self.game_info.map_size.width, 0, self.game_info.map_size.height)


The explore function checks for idle SCVs and sends them to move to random locations around their current position. The random_location_variance function is a helper function that generates a new position within a specified maximum distance from a given position.

This basic exploring function can be improved by taking into account the map's terrain and expansion locations, and by using a more intelligent exploration strategy that covers the map more efficiently. Additionally, you might want to limit the number of SCVs exploring to avoid negatively impacting your economy.

Merge them into pysc2 to create an advanced AI that use LSTM, ReLU, HDQN please
--------------------------
Merging the simple bot example into a more advanced AI using PySC2 and deep learning techniques like LSTM, ReLU, and HDQN is a complex and lengthy task. It is beyond the scope of a single response to provide the complete code. However, I can provide a high-level overview of the process and some guidance on how to get started.

Install PySC2 and Tensorflow:
Copy code
pip install pysc2 tensorflow


Implement feature extraction: Convert game state and observations into a suitable format for your neural network. This includes unit types, positions, health, and other relevant information.

Create a neural network architecture: Design a neural network using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for handling time series data and ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation functions. The HDQN (Heterogeneous Deep Q-Network) can be used for learning multiple tasks and sharing knowledge between them.

Train the neural network: Collect a dataset of game replays or use reinforcement learning techniques like Q-learning or policy gradients to train your AI. You can use TensorFlow or another deep learning library like PyTorch to implement and train your model.

Implement the PySC2 agent: Create a custom agent class that inherits from the PySC2 agent class and uses your trained neural network to make decisions.

Integrate your agent into the StarCraft II environment: Use the PySC2 library to run your agent in the game and test its performance.

Here is a basic template for creating a PySC2 agent:

python
Copy code
import numpy as np
from pysc2.agents import base_agent
from pysc2.lib import actions
from pysc2.lib import features

class AdvancedAI(base_agent.BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

    def step(self, obs):
        super().step(obs)
        # Perform feature extraction from the observation
        state_features = self.extract_features(obs)

        # Use your trained neural network to predict the action
        action = self.predict_action(state_features)

        # Execute the action in the game environment
        return actions.FunctionCall(action, [])

    def extract_features(self, obs):
        # Implement feature extraction from the observation
        pass

    def predict_action(self, state_features):
        # Use your trained neural network to predict the action based on state_features
        pass


This template provides a starting point for implementing an advanced AI using PySC2. You will need to fill in the feature extraction, neural network prediction, and action execution parts with your own implementation.

I highly recommend checking out the following resources to learn more about creating advanced StarCraft II AIs using deep learning techniques:

DeepMind's StarCraft II Learning Environment (SC2LE) paper
DeepMind's PySC2 repository
OpenAI's Five - A successful Dota 2 AI project that can provide inspiration and guidance for creating advanced AIs in complex strategy games.
--------------------------
More codes please
--------------------------
Creating a complete advanced StarCraft II AI using deep learning techniques like LSTM, ReLU, and HDQN is a complex task that requires a significant amount of code and time. However, I can provide you with a more detailed template that you can use as a starting point for your project.

First, create a file called advanced_ai.py and add the following code. This will serve as the main entry point for running the PySC2 agent.
python
Copy code
import sys
from absl import app
from pysc2 import run_configs
from pysc2.env import sc2_env
from pysc2.lib import maps
from advanced_agent import AdvancedAgent

def main(_):
    map_name = "Simple64"
    players = [sc2_env.Agent(sc2_env.Race.terran), sc2_env.Bot(sc2_env.Race.random, sc2_env.Difficulty.very_easy)]

    with sc2_env.SC2Env(map_name=map_name, players=players) as env:
        agent = AdvancedAgent()

        for episode in range(10):
            timesteps = env.reset()
            agent.reset()

            while True:
                actions = [agent.step(timesteps[0])]
                timesteps = env.step(actions)
                if timesteps[0].last():
                    break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(main)

Next, create another file called advanced_agent.py. This file will contain the AdvancedAgent class, which inherits from base_agent.BaseAgent. Add the following code to this file:
python
Copy code
import numpy as np
from pysc2.agents import base_agent
from pysc2.lib import actions

class AdvancedAgent(base_agent.BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

    def step(self, obs):
        super().step(obs)
        # Perform feature extraction from the observation
        state_features = self.extract_features(obs)

        # Use your trained neural network to predict the action
        action = self.predict_action(state_features)

        # Execute the action in the game environment
        return actions.FunctionCall(action, [])

    def extract_features(self, obs):
        # Implement feature extraction from the observation
        # This function should return a NumPy array or a tensor that can be used as input for your neural network
        pass

    def predict_action(self, state_features):
        # Use your trained neural network to predict the action based on state_features
        # This function should return the action to be executed by the agent
        pass


Now you need to create your neural network using a deep learning library like TensorFlow or PyTorch. This will involve designing the architecture, training the network, and saving the model. You can use LSTM for handling time series data, ReLU activation functions, and HDQN for learning multiple tasks.

Once your neural network is trained and saved, you can load the model in the AdvancedAgent class and use it to make predictions. Implement the extract_features and predict_action methods in the AdvancedAgent class to use your neural network.

Note that the above code serves as a template and starting point for implementing an advanced StarCraft II AI using PySC2 and deep learning techniques. You'll need to fill in the details for feature extraction, neural network prediction, and action execution with your own implementation.

Creating an advanced StarCraft II AI requires extensive knowledge of the game, AI techniques, and deep learning frameworks. It may take considerable time and effort to build a successful and competitive AI.
--------------------------
Multiple agent training codes please
--------------------------
Creating a multi-agent training environment for StarCraft II using PySC2 involves setting up multiple instances of your custom agent and using a reinforcement learning technique, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to train the agents. I'll provide a high-level overview of the process and a template for setting up the training loop.

Install the necessary libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install pysc2 tensorflow-gpu

Create a file called train_multi_agent.py with the following code. This sets up the training environment with multiple instances of your custom agent and the training loop:
python
Copy code
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from pysc2 import run_configs
from pysc2.env import sc2_env
from pysc2.lib import maps
from advanced_agent import AdvancedAgent

# Set training parameters
num_agents = 4
num_episodes = 1000
map_name = "Simple64"
players = [sc2_env.Agent(sc2_env.Race.terran) for _ in range(num_agents)]

# Create and initialize agents
agents = [AdvancedAgent() for _ in range(num_agents)]

# Create the environment
with sc2_env.SC2Env(map_name=map_name, players=players) as env:
    # Training loop
    for episode in range(num_episodes):
        timesteps = env.reset()

        for agent in agents:
            agent.reset()

        episode_rewards = np.zeros(num_agents)
        done = False

        while not done:
            actions = [agent.step(timestep) for agent, timestep in zip(agents, timesteps)]

            # Collect agent actions and perform an environment step
            timesteps = env.step(actions)

            # Calculate rewards and check if the episode is done
            rewards = [timestep.reward for timestep in timesteps]
            episode_rewards += rewards
            done = any([timestep.last() for timestep in timesteps])

        # Update agent policies using the collected rewards and observations
        # This step depends on the reinforcement learning algorithm you are using (e.g., PPO, A3C)
        # train_agents(agents, episode_rewards, ...)

    # Save the trained agents
    # save_agents(agents)


This code initializes multiple instances of your custom AdvancedAgent and sets up a training loop. The agents interact with the environment, and the collected rewards and observations can be used to update the agents' policies using a reinforcement learning algorithm like PPO.

You will need to implement the reinforcement learning algorithm, such as PPO, for training the agents. This involves creating a neural network architecture, defining the loss functions, and updating the network weights based on the collected rewards and observations.

Update the AdvancedAgent class in the advanced_agent.py file to use the trained neural network for making predictions during the training process.

Note that this code serves as a high-level template for training multiple agents in the StarCraft II environment using PySC2. You'll need to implement the reinforcement learning algorithm and integrate it into the provided training loop. Creating a multi-agent training environment and implementing reinforcement learning algorithms require significant knowledge of AI and deep learning techniques.
--------------------------
How about replace tensorflow to pytorch
--------------------------
To replace TensorFlow with PyTorch in your multi-agent StarCraft II training setup, you will need to adjust your training loop, neural network architecture, and policy update method to use PyTorch instead. Here's a high-level overview of the necessary adjustments:

Install the necessary libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install pysc2 torch

Adjust the train_multi_agent.py file to use PyTorch. You will need to modify the training loop and update the agent policies using a PyTorch-compatible reinforcement learning algorithm like PPO:
python
Copy code
import numpy as np
import torch
from pysc2 import run_configs
from pysc2.env import sc2_env
from pysc2.lib import maps
from advanced_agent import AdvancedAgent

# Set training parameters
num_agents = 4
num_episodes = 1000
map_name = "Simple64"
players = [sc2_env.Agent(sc2_env.Race.terran) for _ in range(num_agents)]

# Create and initialize agents
agents = [AdvancedAgent() for _ in range(num_agents)]

# Create the environment
with sc2_env.SC2Env(map_name=map_name, players=players) as env:
    # Training loop
    for episode in range(num_episodes):
        timesteps = env.reset()

        for agent in agents:
            agent.reset()

        episode_rewards = np.zeros(num_agents)
        done = False

        while not done:
            actions = [agent.step(timestep) for agent, timestep in zip(agents, timesteps)]

            # Collect agent actions and perform an environment step
            timesteps = env.step(actions)

            # Calculate rewards and check if the episode is done
            rewards = [timestep.reward for timestep in timesteps]
            episode_rewards += rewards
            done = any([timestep.last() for timestep in timesteps])

        # Update agent policies using the collected rewards and observations
        # This step depends on the reinforcement learning algorithm you are using (e.g., PPO, A3C)
        # train_agents(agents, episode_rewards, ...)

    # Save the trained agents
    # save_agents(agents)


Update your AdvancedAgent class and reinforcement learning algorithm implementation to use PyTorch instead of TensorFlow. This will involve creating a PyTorch neural network model, defining loss functions, and updating the network weights based on the collected rewards and observations.

In the advanced_agent.py file, update the AdvancedAgent class to use the PyTorch-trained neural network for making predictions during the training process.

Keep in mind that this code serves as a high-level template for training multiple agents in the StarCraft II environment using PySC2 and PyTorch. You will need to implement the reinforcement learning algorithm and integrate it into the provided training loop. Creating a multi-agent training environment and implementing reinforcement learning algorithms require significant knowledge of AI and deep learning techniques.
--------------------------
Add anti-stealth 
--------------------------
To add anti-stealth capabilities to your StarCraft II bot, you will need to detect and counter stealth units such as Dark Templars and Banshees. To do this, you can use detectors like Missile Turrets, Sensor Towers, and Ravens for the Terran race. In this example, I will demonstrate how to add a simple anti-stealth strategy for the Terran race by building Missile Turrets and training Ravens.

First, modify your AdvancedAgent class in the advanced_agent.py file to include the following methods for building Missile Turrets and training Ravens:

python
Copy code
from pysc2.lib import units, actions, features

# ...

class AdvancedAgent(base_agent.BaseAgent):
    # ...

    async def build_missile_turret(self, obs):
        if self.units(units.Terran.EngineeringBay).ready.exists:
            scvs = self.units(units.Terran.SCV).ready
            if scvs.exists:
                scv = scvs.random
                target = self.find_placement(units.Terran.MissileTurret, scv.position, placement_radius=8)
                if target is not None:
                    await self.do(scv.build(units.Terran.MissileTurret, target))

    async def build_engineering_bay(self, obs):
        if (
            self.units(units.Terran.CommandCenter).ready.exists
            and not self.units(units.Terran.EngineeringBay).exists
        ):
            scvs = self.units(units.Terran.SCV).ready
            if scvs.exists:
                scv = scvs.random
                target = self.find_placement(units.Terran.EngineeringBay, scv.position, placement_radius=8)
                if target is not None:
                    await self.do(scv.build(units.Terran.EngineeringBay, target))

    async def train_raven(self, obs):
        for starport in self.units(units.Terran.Starport).ready.noqueue:
            if self.can_afford(units.Terran.Raven):
                await self.do(starport.train(units.Terran.Raven))


Next, add calls to the new methods inside the on_step method of your AdvancedAgent class:

python
Copy code
class AdvancedAgent(base_agent.BaseAgent):
    async def on_step(self, iteration):
        # ...
        await self.build_engineering_bay(obs)
        await self.build_missile_turret(obs)
        await self.train_raven(obs)
        # ...


This implementation will construct an Engineering Bay, build Missile Turrets, and train Ravens to provide detection capabilities against stealth units. The bot will build Missile Turrets around the base and train Ravens that can move around the map to detect cloaked or burrowed enemy units.

You can further improve this anti-stealth strategy by adjusting the placement of Missile Turrets, the number of Ravens, and how they are controlled. Also, consider other detection options like Sensor Towers to improve your bot's map awareness.

Please note that this example is based on the previously provided AdvancedAgent template, and you may need to adapt it to your specific implementation.
--------------------------
Nice, upgrage the on_step structure then.
--------------------------
To upgrade the on_step structure in the AdvancedAgent class, you can refactor the code to make it more modular and easier to maintain. I will demonstrate how to create separate methods for each action and use a decision-making function to determine which action to perform.

First, create separate methods for each action in your advanced_agent.py file:

python
Copy code
class AdvancedAgent(base_agent.BaseAgent):
    # ...

    async def manage_workers(self, obs):
        # Add your worker management logic here

    async def manage_supply(self, obs):
        # Add your supply management logic here

    async def manage_army(self, obs):
        # Add your army management logic here

    async def manage_technology(self, obs):
        # Add your technology management logic here

    async def manage_economy(self, obs):
        # Add your economy management logic here

    async def scout_and_attack(self, obs):
        # Add your scouting and attacking logic here


Next, create a decision-making function that determines which action to perform:

python
Copy code
class AdvancedAgent(base_agent.BaseAgent):
    # ...

    def decide_action(self, obs):
        # Implement your decision-making logic here
        # You can use the observation data to make decisions based on the current game state

        # Example: prioritize actions based on a predefined order
        actions = [
            self.manage_workers,
            self.manage_supply,
            self.manage_army,
            self.manage_technology,
            self.manage_economy,
            self.scout_and_attack,
        ]

        return actions


Finally, update the on_step method to use the decision-making function and execute the chosen action:

python
Copy code
class AdvancedAgent(base_agent.BaseAgent):
    async def on_step(self, iteration):
        actions = self.decide_action(self.obs)
        
        for action in actions:
            await action(self.obs)


This upgraded on_step structure allows you to organize your agent's actions into separate methods and use a decision-making function to determine which action to perform. This makes the code more modular and easier to maintain. You can further improve the decision-making function by implementing more sophisticated logic based on the current game state, such as taking into account the type of opponent or adapting to the opponent's strategy.

Please note that this example is based on the previously provided AdvancedAgent template, and you may need to adapt it to your specific implementation.

Here's the AdvancedAgent class with the upgraded on_step structure and the anti-stealth strategy integrated:

python
Copy code
from pysc2.agents import base_agent
from pysc2.lib import units, actions, features

class AdvancedAgent(base_agent.BaseAgent):
    # ...

    async def manage_workers(self, obs):
        # Add your worker management logic here

    async def manage_supply(self, obs):
        # Add your supply management logic here

    async def manage_army(self, obs):
        # Add your army management logic here

    async def manage_technology(self, obs):
        # Add your technology management logic here

    async def manage_economy(self, obs):
        # Add your economy management logic here

    async def scout_and_attack(self, obs):
        # Add your scouting and attacking logic here

    async def build_missile_turret(self, obs):
        if self.units(units.Terran.EngineeringBay).ready.exists:
            scvs = self.units(units.Terran.SCV).ready
            if scvs.exists:
                scv = scvs.random
                target = self.find_placement(units.Terran.MissileTurret, scv.position, placement_radius=8)
                if target is not None:
                    await self.do(scv.build(units.Terran.MissileTurret, target))

    async def build_engineering_bay(self, obs):
        if (
            self.units(units.Terran.CommandCenter).ready.exists
            and not self.units(units.Terran.EngineeringBay).exists
        ):
            scvs = self.units(units.Terran.SCV).ready
            if scvs.exists:
                scv = scvs.random
                target = self.find_placement(units.Terran.EngineeringBay, scv.position, placement_radius=8)
                if target is not None:
                    await self.do(scv.build(units.Terran.EngineeringBay, target))

    async def train_raven(self, obs):
        for starport in self.units(units.Terran.Starport).ready.noqueue:
            if self.can_afford(units.Terran.Raven):
                await self.do(starport.train(units.Terran.Raven))

    def decide_action(self, obs):
        actions = [
            self.manage_workers,
            self.manage_supply,
            self.manage_army,
            self.manage_technology,
            self.manage_economy,
            self.scout_and_attack,
            self.build_engineering_bay,
            self.build_missile_turret,
            self.train_raven,
        ]

        return actions

    async def on_step(self, iteration):
        actions = self.decide_action(self.obs)
        
        for action in actions:
            await action(self.obs)


In this updated AdvancedAgent class, the on_step method has been restructured to separate the different actions into individual methods, and the anti-stealth strategy has been added by building Missile Turrets and training Ravens.

Please note that this example is based on the previously provided AdvancedAgent template, and you may need to adapt it to your specific implementation.

Add manage_workers action that has maximum limited in each command center
--------------------------
To create a manage_workers action that maintains a maximum worker limit per Command Center, you can follow these steps:

Add a constant for the maximum number of workers per Command Center at the beginning of your AdvancedAgent class:
python
Copy code
class AdvancedAgent(base_agent.BaseAgent):
    MAX_WORKERS_PER_CC = 16
    # ...

Implement the manage_workers method in the AdvancedAgent class to train workers while respecting the worker limit:
python
Copy code
class AdvancedAgent(base_agent.BaseAgent):
    # ...

    async def manage_workers(self, obs):
        command_centers = self.units(units.Terran.CommandCenter).ready
        scvs = self.units(units.Terran.SCV)

        for cc in command_centers:
            cc_scvs = scvs.closer_than(15, cc)
            if len(cc_scvs) < self.MAX_WORKERS_PER_CC and cc.noqueue and self.can_afford(units.Terran.SCV):
                await self.do(cc.train(units.Terran.SCV))


This manage_workers method iterates through each ready Command Center and checks the number of SCVs nearby. If there are fewer SCVs than the maximum worker limit, the method trains additional workers.

Please note that this implementation assumes you already have methods for managing resources, building structures, and other essential tasks in your AdvancedAgent. The example provided is based on the previously provided AdvancedAgent template, and you may need to adapt it to your specific implementation.
--------------------------
Add manage_workers action
--------------------------
To add a manage_workers action in your AdvancedAgent class, you can implement a method that trains workers and ensures a balanced distribution of workers for gathering resources. Here's an example of how to implement this method:

python
Copy code
from pysc2.lib import actions, units

class AdvancedAgent(base_agent.BaseAgent):
    # ...

    async def manage_workers(self, obs):
        scvs = self.units(units.Terran.SCV)
        command_centers = self.units(units.Terran.CommandCenter).ready

        if command_centers.exists:
            cc = command_centers.first

            # Train more workers if there are less than 16 SCVs
            if scvs.amount < 16 and cc.noqueue and self.can_afford(units.Terran.SCV):
                await self.do(cc.train(units.Terran.SCV))

            # Assign idle workers to gather resources
            idle_scvs = scvs.idle
            if idle_scvs.exists:
                scv = idle_scvs.random

                # Gather minerals
                minerals = self.state.mineral_field.closest_to(scv)
                if minerals:
                    await self.do(scv.gather(minerals))

                # Gather vespene gas
                refineries = self.units(units.Terran.Refinery).ready
                if refineries.exists:
                    refinery = refineries.closest_to(scv)
                    if refinery:
                        await self.do(scv.gather(refinery))


In this example, the manage_workers method trains more SCVs if there are less than 16 of them, and it assigns idle SCVs to gather resources such as minerals and vespene gas.

Now, include the manage_workers action in the on_step method of your AdvancedAgent class:

python
Copy code
class AdvancedAgent(base_agent.BaseAgent):
    async def on_step(self, iteration):
        # ...
        await self.manage_workers(self.obs)
        # ...


Keep in mind that this example assumes you have already implemented methods for managing resources, building structures, and other essential tasks in your AdvancedAgent. The provided code is based on the previously provided AdvancedAgent template, and you may need to adapt it to your specific implementation.
--------------------------
Add manage_supply gradually.
--------------------------
To implement a manage_supply action that gradually increases supply in your AdvancedAgent class, you can create a method that builds Supply Depots based on the current supply usage. Here's an example of how to implement this method:

python
Copy code
from pysc2.lib import actions, units

class AdvancedAgent(base_agent.BaseAgent):
    # ...

    async def manage_supply(self, obs):
        supply_limit = obs.observation.player.food_cap
        current_supply = obs.observation.player.food_used
        supply_ratio = current_supply / supply_limit

        if supply_ratio > 0.8 and self.can_afford(units.Terran.SupplyDepot):
            scvs = self.units(units.Terran.SCV).ready
            if scvs.exists:
                scv = scvs.random
                target = self.find_placement(units.Terran.SupplyDepot, scv.position, placement_radius=8)
                if target is not None:
                    await self.do(scv.build(units.Terran.SupplyDepot, target))


In this example, the manage_supply method calculates the supply usage ratio and builds a Supply Depot when the ratio is greater than 0.8 (80% supply usage). This approach allows for a gradual increase in supply based on the current demand.

Now, include the manage_supply action in the on_step method of your AdvancedAgent class:

python
Copy code
class AdvancedAgent(base_agent.BaseAgent):
    async def on_step(self, iteration):
        # ...
        await self.manage_supply(self.obs)
        # ...


Keep in mind that this example assumes you have already implemented methods for managing resources, building structures, and other essential tasks in your AdvancedAgent. The provided code is based on the previously provided AdvancedAgent template, and you may need to adapt it to your specific implementation.
--------------------------
Add manage_army function
--------------------------
To add a manage_army function in your AdvancedAgent class, you can implement a method that trains combat units, such as Marines, and sets a rally point for them. Here's an example of how to implement this method:

python
Copy code
from pysc2.lib import actions, units

class AdvancedAgent(base_agent.BaseAgent):
    # ...

    async def manage_army(self, obs):
        barracks = self.units(units.Terran.Barracks).ready
        if barracks.exists:
            barrack = barracks.first

            # Train Marines if there are less than 20 Marines
            marines = self.units(units.Terran.Marine)
            if marines.amount < 20 and barrack.noqueue and self.can_afford(units.Terran.Marine):
                await self.do(barrack.train(units.Terran.Marine))

            # Set rally point for Marines
            rally_point = self.state.mineral_field.closest_to(barrack)
            if rally_point:
                await self.do(barrack.rally_units(rally_point))


In this example, the manage_army method trains Marines if there are less than 20 of them and sets a rally point for them at the closest mineral field.

Now, include the manage_army action in the on_step method of your AdvancedAgent class:

python
Copy code
class AdvancedAgent(base_agent.BaseAgent):
    async def on_step(self, iteration):
        # ...
        await self.manage_army(self.obs)
        # ...


Keep in mind that this example assumes you have already implemented methods for managing resources, building structures, and other essential tasks in your AdvancedAgent. The provided code is based on the previously provided AdvancedAgent template, and you may need to adapt it to your specific implementation.
--------------------------
Add manage_army function that can manage all kind of units
--------------------------
To create a manage_army function that can manage different types of units, you can implement a method that trains various combat units and assigns them specific roles or targets. Here's an example of how to implement this method:

python
Copy code
from pysc2.lib import actions, units

class AdvancedAgent(base_agent.BaseAgent):
    # ...

    async def manage_army(self, obs):
        # Train Marines
        await self.train_units(units.Terran.Barracks, units.Terran.Marine, 20)

        # Train Siege Tanks
        await self.train_units(units.Terran.Factory, units.Terran.SiegeTank, 5)

        # Train Medivacs
        await self.train_units(units.Terran.Starport, units.Terran.Medivac, 3)

    async def train_units(self, production_building_unit, unit_to_train, max_units):
        production_buildings = self.units(production_building_unit).ready
        if production_buildings.exists:
            building = production_buildings.first
            unit_count = self.units(unit_to_train).amount

            if unit_count < max_units and building.noqueue and self.can_afford(unit_to_train):
                await self.do(building.train(unit_to_train))


In this example, the manage_army method trains Marines, Siege Tanks, and Medivacs. The training is performed by the train_units function, which accepts parameters for the production building type, the unit type to train, and the maximum number of units to train.

Now, include the manage_army action in the on_step method of your AdvancedAgent class:

python
Copy code
class AdvancedAgent(base_agent.BaseAgent):
    async def on_step(self, iteration):
        # ...
        await self.manage_army(self.obs)
        # ...


Keep in mind that this example assumes you have already implemented methods for managing resources, building structures, and other essential tasks in your AdvancedAgent. The provided code is based on the previously provided AdvancedAgent template, and you may need to adapt it to your specific implementation.
--------------------------
Add manage_army function that can manage military from Terran
--------------------------
To create a manage_army function that can manage the military units of the Terran race, you can implement a method that trains a variety of combat units and sets a rally point for them. Here's an example of how to implement this method:

python
Copy code
from pysc2.lib import actions, units

class AdvancedAgent(base_agent.BaseAgent):
    # ...

    async def manage_army(self, obs):
        # Train Marines
        await self.train_units(units.Terran.Barracks, units.Terran.Marine, 20)

        # Train Marauders
        await self.train_units(units.Terran.Barracks, units.Terran.Marauder, 10)

        # Train Siege Tanks
        await self.train_units(units.Terran.Factory, units.Terran.SiegeTank, 5)

        # Train Medivacs
        await self.train_units(units.Terran.Starport, units.Terran.Medivac, 3)

        # Train Vikings
        await self.train_units(units.Terran.Starport, units.Terran.Viking, 4)

        # Train Battlecruisers
        await self.train_units(units.Terran.Starport, units.Terran.Battlecruiser, 2)

    async def train_units(self, production_building_unit, unit_to_train, max_units):
        production_buildings = self.units(production_building_unit).ready
        if production_buildings.exists:
            building = production_buildings.first
            unit_count = self.units(unit_to_train).amount

            if unit_count < max_units and building.noqueue and self.can_afford(unit_to_train):
                await self.do(building.train(unit_to_train))


In this example, the manage_army method trains various Terran units like Marines, Marauders, Siege Tanks, Medivacs, Vikings, and Battlecruisers. The training is performed by the train_units function, which accepts parameters for the production building type, the unit type to train, and the maximum number of units to train.

Now, include the manage_army action in the on_step method of your AdvancedAgent class:

python
Copy code
class AdvancedAgent(base_agent.BaseAgent):
    async def on_step(self, iteration):
        # ...
        await self.manage_army(self.obs)
        # ...


Keep in mind that this example assumes you have already implemented methods for managing resources, building structures, and other essential tasks in your AdvancedAgent. The provided code is based on the previously provided AdvancedAgent template, and you may need to adapt it to your specific implementation.
--------------------------
Add iteration to loop actions randomly
--------------------------
To create an on_step function that iterates over a list of actions and performs them randomly, you can use the random module to shuffle the actions before executing them. Here's an example of how to implement this:

python
Copy code
import random
from pysc2.lib import actions, units

class AdvancedAgent(base_agent.BaseAgent):
    # ...

    async def on_step(self, iteration):
        # List of actions
        actions_list = [
            self.manage_workers,
            self.manage_supply,
            self.manage_army,
            self.build_structures,
            self.attack
        ]

        # Shuffle the actions list
        random.shuffle(actions_list)

        # Execute the actions in the shuffled order
        for action in actions_list:
            await action(self.obs)
    
    # ...


In this example, the on_step method creates a list of available actions and shuffles it using random.shuffle. It then iterates over the shuffled list and executes each action. You can add any action methods you have implemented in your AdvancedAgent class to the actions_list.

Keep in mind that this example assumes you have already implemented methods for managing resources, building structures, and other essential tasks in your AdvancedAgent. The provided code is based on the previously provided AdvancedAgent template, and you may need to adapt it to your specific implementation.

What is butterfly in graphical views
--------------------------
In graphical views, the term "butterfly" often refers to a visual representation of a plot or a shape that resembles a butterfly's wings. This can occur in various types of visualizations, such as scatter plots, line plots, or even frequency distributions, where the data points or lines form a symmetrical pattern similar to a butterfly.

One common example is the "butterfly plot" used in some scientific fields, such as meteorology and climate science. These plots visualize differences between two datasets or models by plotting them on the same axes, often using mirror-like symmetry. The resulting plot resembles the shape of a butterfly, with one "wing" representing the data from one dataset or model and the other "wing" representing the data from the other dataset or model.

Another example is in signal processing or audio analysis, where a "butterfly" shape can appear in a frequency-domain plot, representing symmetrical amplitude or power distribution across frequencies.

It's essential to understand that the term "butterfly" in graphical views is not a specific type of plot or visualization but rather a description of the resulting shape formed by the data points or lines in the plot.
--------------------------
What is calls&called by in graphical views?
--------------------------
The previous model used in this conversation is unavailable. We've switched you to the latest default model

In graphical views, "calls" and "called by" refer to the relationship between functions or methods in a program or software. This relationship is often visualized in the form of a call graph, which shows how functions or methods call each other during program execution.

"Called by" refers to the functions or methods that call a particular function or method. In other words, it shows the incoming calls to a function or method.

"Calls" refers to the functions or methods that a particular function or method calls during its execution. In other words, it shows the outgoing calls from a function or method.

In a call graph visualization, nodes represent functions or methods, and edges represent the calls between them. The "called by" relationship is represented by edges pointing towards a node, while the "calls" relationship is represented by edges pointing away from a node.

Understanding the relationships between functions or methods in a program can be helpful in identifying bottlenecks, optimizing code, and debugging errors. By visualizing the call graph, developers can see the flow of program execution and identify potential performance issues or areas for improvement.

Graphical views options in scitools' Understand
--------------------------
Scitools' Understand is a software tool that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize code and software systems. Here are some of the graphical views options available in Scitools' Understand:

Graph View: This view displays a graph of the software system's components and their relationships. The graph can be customized to show different types of relationships, such as function calls or inheritance.

Call Tree View: This view displays a hierarchical view of the function calls in the code. It shows the calling relationship between functions, with the main function at the top.

Class Tree View: This view displays a hierarchical view of the classes in the code. It shows the inheritance relationships between classes, with the base class at the top.

Metrics View: This view displays a list of metrics for the code, such as cyclomatic complexity and code coverage. The metrics can be sorted and filtered to identify areas for improvement.

Dependency Structure Matrix (DSM) View: This view displays a matrix of the dependencies between the components in the code. It can be used to identify circular dependencies and other issues in the code.

Control Flow View: This view displays a diagram of the control flow in the code. It shows the paths of execution through the code and can be used to identify potential errors or bottlenecks.

Call Graph View: This view displays a graph of the function calls in the code. It can be used to identify the relationships between functions and to optimize the code.

Overall, the graphical views in Scitools' Understand provide developers with a powerful set of tools for analyzing and visualizing code and software systems. They can help identify potential issues, optimize code, and improve overall software quality.
--------------------------
What is declaratation in graphical views
--------------------------
In graphical views, "declaration" refers to the location in code where a variable, function, or other program element is declared or defined. The declaration typically includes information such as the name, type, and scope of the program element.

Declarations are often represented in graphical views as nodes in a graph or as entries in a table or list. They can be used to navigate the codebase, identify dependencies between program elements, and understand the structure of the code.

For example, in a call graph visualization, a function's declaration might be represented as a node in the graph. The edges connecting the node to other nodes in the graph would represent the function's calls to other functions.

Similarly, in a metrics view, the declarations of variables or functions might be listed along with other information such as their size or complexity. This can help developers identify areas of the code that may need to be refactored or optimized.

Overall, declarations play an important role in understanding and analyzing code, and graphical views can be a powerful tool for visualizing and exploring declarations and their relationships to other program elements.

Add manage_technology function
--------------------------
To add a manage_technology function in your AdvancedAgent class, you can implement a method that researches or upgrades technology for your units and structures. Here's an example of how to implement this method:

python
Copy code
from pysc2.lib import actions, units

class AdvancedAgent(base_agent.BaseAgent):
    # ...

    async def manage_technology(self, obs):
        # Research Stimpacks for Marines
        await self.research_tech(units.Terran.BarracksTechLab, upgrades.TerranStimpack, units.Terran.Marine)

        # Upgrade Infantry Weapons Level 1
        await self.upgrade_tech(units.Terran.EngineeringBay, upgrades.TerranInfantryWeaponsLevel1)

        # Upgrade Building Armor
        await self.upgrade_tech(units.Terran.EngineeringBay, upgrades.TerranBuildingArmor)

    async def research_tech(self, tech_building_unit, tech_to_research, unit_to_upgrade):
        tech_buildings = self.units(tech_building_unit).ready
        if tech_buildings.exists:
            tech_building = tech_buildings.first
            if self.can_afford(tech_to_research) and not self.already_pending(tech_to_research):
                await self.do(tech_building(tech_to_research))
                
            # Upgrade the unit
            for unit in self.units(unit_to_upgrade).ready.noqueue:
                abilities = await self.get_available_abilities(unit)
                if tech_to_research in abilities:
                    await self.do(unit(tech_to_research))

    async def upgrade_tech(self, upgrade_building_unit, tech_to_upgrade):
        upgrade_buildings = self.units(upgrade_building_unit).ready
        if upgrade_buildings.exists:
            upgrade_building = upgrade_buildings.first
            if self.can_afford(tech_to_upgrade) and not self.already_pending(tech_to_upgrade):
                await self.do(upgrade_building.research(tech_to_upgrade))


In this example, the manage_technology method researches Stimpacks for Marines, upgrades Infantry Weapons Level 1 for all infantry units, and upgrades Building Armor for all structures. The research/upgrades are performed by the research_tech and upgrade_tech functions, which accept parameters for the technology building/unit, the technology to research/upgrade, and the unit type to upgrade.

Now, include the manage_technology action in the on_step method of your AdvancedAgent class:

python
Copy code
class AdvancedAgent(base_agent.BaseAgent):
    async def on_step(self, iteration):
        # ...
        await self.manage_technology(self.obs)
        # ...


Keep in mind that this example assumes you have already implemented methods for managing resources, building structures, and other essential tasks in your AdvancedAgent. The provided code is based on the previously provided AdvancedAgent template, and you may need to adapt it to your specific implementation.
--------------------------
Add manage_economy function
--------------------------
To add a manage_economy function in your AdvancedAgent class, you can implement a method that focuses on gathering resources and expanding your economy. Here's an example of how to implement this method:

python
Copy code
from pysc2.lib import actions, features, units

class AdvancedAgent(base_agent.BaseAgent):
    # ...
